In this file I tried my hardest to improvise and get out of my comfort box and add new things to make my 2nd HW different, Although I did get ahead of my self, I plan to make the styling better as I learn more about the new styles I used
Colored scroll bars to grab more attention 
Personal picture to become more personal
I don't have much in the description boxes, I will add more as I go, I just didn't want to make things up just to delete them later
I played around alot with different styles to really see what I could learn and push my limits, I am happy with how much I really learned by doing research on w3 School
One thing I would've liked to add was different fonts and symbols but I could not figure out / understand how to link it properly
I kept adding tons of things and I was having alot of style issues because I am still working on fully understanding how to use the Inspect, It is something I am trying really hard to learn, Once I fully understand How to really use it to my ability, I believe I will be able to master my styling.
When I was brainstorming ways to make this different and learn new things, I thought of adding a link that directs you to my LinkedIn and thru w3 school I learned how to make that happen!

My future goals for this project: 
I would like to come back to it and fix the following
1. the positon of the boxes, margin's/header/padding.
2. Add More info to each section.

I also dont know if this is what the readMe is for but this is my understanding of it, If I am incorrect I am happy to learn!
